Problem 2
=========

Compile
-------

```
$ make 
```

Outputs

`mset_a`: P2 strategy 1; 
`mset_b`: P2 strategy 2; 

Run
---

`mset_*` will generate a 0-1 bitmap to `stdout`, which later we can use to create image. 


```
$ mpiexec -n 10 mset_a > output_a.txt
$ mpiexec -n 10 mset_b > output_b.txt
```

The figures `mset.jpg` and `mset.fig` are generated by Matlab, which firstly load `output.txt`, and then run `imagesc`. 

Strategy
--------

The first strategy is statically assigning rows of points to workers, while the later is dynamically dispathing. 

The key observation of implementation of the sencond strategy is using `MPI_ANY_SOURCE` when receiving message and `status.MPI_SOURCE` when sending next request. 

Stats
-----

*Failed* to set up the mpi environment on Midway, and therefore experiments are conducted on local machine. 

Input matrix is 1000 * 1000. 

### Strategy 1

Elapsed time: 5.658887 sec

### Strategy 2 

Elapsed time: 13.035881 sec


Problem 3 
=========

Env
---

```
$ make
```

Output `p3`. 

```
$ mpiexec -n 2 ./p3
```

Stats
-----

The program send and recv 1000 empty message between a processor pair. 

Throughput is 75.99423 message pairs(including one send and one recv) per second. 

Communication latency is 0.013159 second.
